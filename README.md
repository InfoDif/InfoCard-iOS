# InfoCard-iOS
This is an Xcode project of a sample application for demonstrating InfoCard SDK in IOS devices. InfoCard SDK requires IOS 6.0 at least. 
In order to extract the scanned card information you need to supply a valid SDK token in ViewController.mm. 
Just place your SDK token in places where you see the following
```
[scanOptions setInfocardSDKToken:@"Please use your SDK token here"];
```
Please visit www.infodif.com/infocard and contact us for a trial SDK token
